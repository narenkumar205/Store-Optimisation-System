This python application uses customer data such as age and gender etc etc to create a spending score and help segment the kirana store's customer base using a k-means clustering algorithm and can be further used for other use cases such as optimizing the unit economics of the store in itself




The real time data was gathered from a local NILGIRIS store and a custom tkinter based gui application was built and given to the management of the local NILGIRIS
